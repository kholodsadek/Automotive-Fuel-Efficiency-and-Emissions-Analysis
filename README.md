# 🚗 Automotive Fuel Efficiency & Emissions Analysis

## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on extracting actionable insights from automotive data using **Python-based data cleaning and visualization techniques**. The aim is to identify key factors that influence **fuel efficiency** and **emissions**, clean and prepare the dataset, and visualize the relationships among variables to support data-driven conclusions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and prepare the dataset to resolve quality and tidiness issues
- Explore key relationships between fuel consumption, engine size, and CO₂ emissions
- Visualize trends and distributions using charts and plots
- Gain insight into how vehicle characteristics impact environmental performance

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Tasks

- Handled missing or invalid values across numeric and categorical columns
- Renamed and reformatted column names for clarity
- Converted appropriate columns to correct data types
- Removed duplicates and checked for outliers affecting analysis
- Standardized units where necessary (e.g., engine size, fuel consumption)

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- **Scatter plots**: To visualize the correlation between CO₂ emissions and engine size
- **Box plots**: To detect outliers and compare emissions across vehicle classes
- **Histograms**: To understand distribution of fuel consumption
- **Heatmaps**: To observe correlation between numerical variables

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - `Pandas` – Data cleaning and manipulation
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Code execution and documentation

---

## 📅 Timeline

- **Project Type**: Hands-on Lab – NTI DEY Diploma  
- **Date**: August – September 2024
